Labels help you organize your test cases and test runs, making it easier to filter and track them. In the Manage Labels section, you can:
   - Add new labels to categorize tests based on functionality (e.g., Smoke Test, Regression, API Testing).
   - Edit existing labels to refine test organization as requirements develop.
   - Delete labels you no longer need to keep your test suite clean.
