**Custom fields add specific information in your test cases & help filter test cases.**

---

In Testsigma Test Management, you can create custom fields to add additional, project-specific information to your test cases. These fields help you track attributes beyond the default properties. After creating a custom field, you can add it to test cases and use it to filter and locate specific test cases efficiently. This article discusses how to create a custom field, add it to test cases, and filter test cases using custom field values.
