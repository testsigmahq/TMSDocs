**Learn how to create, organize, and maintain test cases in Test Management by Testsigma.**

---

A test case defines a specific scenario to be tested, including detailed steps, preconditions, expected results, and other relevant information. Test cases are stored in a repository and structured in a hierarchical tree format, with folders and subfolders for better organization.

Managing test cases involves creating, editing, moving, and deleting them. This article discusses how to manage test cases in test management.

---

> ## **Prerequisites**
>
> Before you begin, ensure that a [Project](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/projects/manage-projects/) and [Folders](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-management/test-cases/folders/) are created in Testsigma.
