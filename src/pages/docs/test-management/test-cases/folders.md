Organizing test cases is easier with folders within a project. Testsigma Test Management allows you to create a hierarchical folder structure, where subfolders nest under parent folders for better organization. Each folder displays cumulative test case counts, giving you a clear view of the total test cases within a project. This article discusses creating, managing, and navigating test case folders efficiently.
