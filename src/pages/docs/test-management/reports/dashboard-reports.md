**Get a complete view of your test status, defects, and coverage in one place.**

---

The Dashboard provides a real-time view of your test management activities. It displays key metrics such as test case counts, execution status, automation coverage, test run trends, defects, and review status all from a single screen, without navigating to detailed reports.

These charts dynamically update based on selected filters, such as date range and assignee. This enables you to view data filtered by specific date ranges and individual users.  This article discusses the reports section in the Dashboard.

## **Filters**

### **Date Range**

The charts in the Dashboard displays data from a defined date range. Select a range from the From dropdown to view data for a specific period which is as follows:
- Last 1 day
- Last 7 days
- Last 1 month
- Last 3 months
- Last 6 months
- Last 1 year
- All time

### **Assigned To** 

Use the Assigned To filter to view data for a specific assignee.

You can use this filter to:
- Track user-specific test activities
- Review workload distribution
- Compare execution metrics by user

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| Combine filters to narrow down the data and gain more targeted insights. For example, **Last 1 month + a specific assignee**.
