**Track requirement coverage and validation across test cases, runs, and defects.**

---

A Requirement Traceability Report provides clear visibility into how requirements are validated across test cases, test runs, and defects within a project. It establishes traceability between requirements and their test coverage and execution. Supported requirement sources include Jira, Linear, and ClickUp.

---

> ## **Prerequisites**
> 
> Before you begin, ensure that test cases are generated from requirements, linked to test runs, and include execution results.

## **Report Structure**

### **Report Overview**

The report provides high-level visibility into:
- Requirement distribution by priority (**Critical**, **Major**, **Medium**, **Minor**)
- Test case count and automation coverage (**Manual** vs **Automated**)
- Traceability matrix mapping **Requirements > Test Cases > Test Runs**

### **Key Widgets**

**Requirements by Priority** <br>
Displays the total number of requirements categorized by business priority:
- **Critical**: Must-have functionality that blocks release if failed.
- **Major**: Core functionality that impacts primary workflows.
- **Medium**: Important but non-blocking enhancements.
- **Minor**: Optional or low-impact usability improvements.

**Test Case Count** <br>
Shows the total number of test cases linked to requirements, split by execution type:
- **Manual**: Test cases executed by users.
- **Automated**: Test cases executed via automation workflows.

**Traceability Matrix** <br>
The matrix provides bidirectional mapping between requirements and their test execution evidence.

| **Column**      | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Requirement** | Requirement title or story summary. |
| **Test Cases**  | List of test case IDs linked to the requirement. |
| **Test Runs**   | Test run records showing execution timestamps and status tags (Tested or Untested). |
