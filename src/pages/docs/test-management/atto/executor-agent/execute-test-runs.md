2. Select **Execute with Atto** from the **Action Bar**.

3. Atto reads the test run and fetches all the test cases in the test run.

3. When the test cases appear in Atto, select **Start** next to the test case you want to execute.

3. Atto analyzes the test case and displays the execution plan along with any necessary data.

4. Add any missing data, and then click **Start Testing**.
