**You don’t need more test cases. You need the right ones. This guide shows you how.”**

---

Prompts are the primary way you guide Atto to generate accurate and relevant test cases. A well-written prompt tells Atto what you're testing, how it works, and what you are expecting to see.

You’re not “using Atto.” You’re working with Atto, your coworker who works fast, follows instructions, and doesn’t guess. 

---

## **Why Prompts Matter?**
In AI-augmented testing, prompting is context engineering. You're not just giving instructions; you're shaping Atto’s understanding of the feature, constraints, and test goals.

**Good prompts lead to:**
- More relevant and precise test cases
- Better edge case handling
- Smarter suggestions and optimizations
- Less back-and-forth and reduced rework

---

## **What Makes a Good Prompt?**
Think of a prompt like a well-written test case title or bug report. It should be clear, contextual, and actionable.

**Use the WHO + WHAT + WHY + HOW + EXAMPLES model:**



| **Element** | **Description**                             | **Example**                                             |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **WHO**     | User role or system under test              | “As a registered user…”                                |
| **WHAT**    | Feature or action being tested              | “…resetting a password…”                               |
| **WHY**     | Purpose or expected behavior                | “…to ensure expired tokens are handled.”               |
| **HOW**     | Constraints, variations, platforms          | “Include 2FA and expired token scenarios.”             |
| **EXAMPLES**| Seed inputs or expected output              | “E.g., the token expires after 10 minutes.”            |

## **Prompt Builder Checklist**

Use this framework to structure your prompt before submitting it:
- **Goal**: What do you want Atto to generate or help with?
- **Context**: What feature, flow, or user story is involved?
- **Inputs**: Did you attach Stories, Files, Designs and other relevant files?
- **Edge Cases**: Any tricky or high-risk conditions to include?

If that’s all in, you’re good!

---

## **Pro Tips**
- **Use personas**: “As a manual tester…” or “As a mobile user…”
- Tag old stories, test cases, or flows if they’re relevant
- **Refine iteratively**: Refine tests with Atto to make them test-ready.
