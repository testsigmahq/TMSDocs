**Integrate Travis CI with Test Management by Testsigma and automate your test runs and generate test reports.**

---

Integrate Travis CI with Test Management by Testsigma to automate test executions and generate test reports through CI/CD pipelines. This article discusses integrating Travis CI with Test Management by Testsigma.

---

> ## **Prerequisites**
> 
> Before you begin, ensure:
> - You have a **Project** in Test Management by Testsigma and **Test Runs** are available.
> - You have an API token from Test Management by Testsigma.
> - You have a [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/) account.

## **Set Environment Variables in Travis CI**

1. Navigate to your project in **Travis CI**.

2. Open **Settings**.

3. Under **Environment Variables**, add the following:
   - **Name**: `TESTSIGMA_API_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: API token from Testsigma

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| Ensure the option **Display value in build log** is disabled.

## **Configure the Travis CI Pipeline**

1. Navigate to your **Travis CI** repository. 

2. Open or create the `.travis.yml` file in the root directory.

3. Add the following code into the `.travis.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    language: java
    jdk:
    - openjdk8

    env:
    global:
        - TESTSIGMA_API_TOKEN=${TESTSIGMA_API_TOKEN}

    script:
    # ðŸ”¨ Build and test using Maven
    - echo "Running Maven build and tests..."
    - mvn clean package

    after_success:
    # ðŸ“¤ Upload JUnit report to Testsigma
    - echo "Uploading JUnit results to Testsigma..."
    - curl --location 'https://test-management.testsigma.com/api/v1/projects/<Project_ID>/junit-import/test-run/<Run_ID>' \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $TESTSIGMA_API_TOKEN" \
        --form "junit_xml=@target/surefire-reports/TEST-MyTests.xml"
    ```

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| - Replace `<Project_ID>` in the curl command with your Project ID, which you can retrieve using the Test Management by Testsigma APIs.
| - Replace `<Run_ID>` in the curl command with the Run ID, which is available in the URL when viewing a test run in the format: `https://test-management.testsigma.com/ui/test_runs/<Run_ID>/`
| - Ensure the path to the JUnit report points to the actual XML file generated by Maven.

## **Triggering the Pipeline**

1. Push a commit to the **main** (or configured) branch.


2. **Travis CI** will run the workflow.


3. After completion, the corresponding test run in Test Management by Testsigma will be automatically updated with the test execution results.
