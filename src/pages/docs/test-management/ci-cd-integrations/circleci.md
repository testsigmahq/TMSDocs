**Integrate CircleCI with Test Management by Testsigma and automate your test runs and generate test reports.**

---

Integrate CircleCI with Test Management by Testsigma to automate test executions and generate test reports through CI/CD pipelines. This article discusses integrating CircleCI with Test Management by Testsigma.

---

> ## **Prerequisites**
> 
> Before you begin, ensure:
> - You have a **Project** in Test Management by Testsigma and **Test Runs** are available.
> - You have an API token from Test Management by Testsigma.
> - You have a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) account.


---

## **Set Environment Variables in CircleCI**

1. Navigate to your project in **CircleCI**.

2. Go to **Project Settings > Environment Variables**.

3. Add a new variable:
   - **Name**: `TESTSIGMA_API_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: API token from Testsigma

[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| Ensure this value is kept secret and not displayed in logs.

---

## **Configure the CircleCI Pipeline**

1. Navigate to your **CircleCI** repository. 

2. Open or create the `.circleci/config.yml` file in the root directory.

3. Add the following code into the `.circleci/config.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    version: 2.1

    jobs:
    build:
        docker:
        - image: cimg/openjdk:8.0
        environment:
        TESTSIGMA_API_TOKEN: << pipeline.parameters.testsigma_api_token >>

        steps:
        # âœ… Step 1: Check out the code
        - checkout

        # ðŸ”¨ Step 2: Build and test with Maven
        - run:
            name: ðŸ”¨ Build and Test with Maven
            command: mvn clean package

        # ðŸ“¤ Step 3: Upload JUnit results to Testsigma
        - run:
            name: ðŸ“¤ Upload JUnit Results to Testsigma
            command: |
                echo "Uploading JUnit results to Testsigma..."
                curl --location 'https://test-management.testsigma.com/api/v1/projects/<Project_ID>/junit-import/test-run/<Run_ID>' \
                --header "Authorization: Bearer $TESTSIGMA_API_TOKEN" \
                --form "junit_xml=@target/surefire-reports/TEST-MyTests.xml"

    workflows:
    version: 2
    test_and_upload:
        jobs:
        - build:
            parameters:
                testsigma_api_token:
                type: env_var_name
                default: TESTSIGMA_API_TOKEN
    ```


[[info | **NOTE**:]]
| - Replace `<Project_ID>` in the curl command with your Project ID, which you can retrieve using the Test Management by Testsigma APIs.
| - Replace `<Run_ID>` in the curl command with the Run ID, which is available in the URL when viewing a test run in the format: `https://test-management.testsigma.com/ui/test_runs/<Run_ID>/`
| - Ensure the path to the JUnit report points to the actual XML file generated by Maven.

## **Triggering the Pipeline**

1. Commit and push your changes to the repository connected to CircleCI.


2. **CircleCI** will run the workflow.


3. After completion, the corresponding test run in Test Management by Testsigma will be automatically updated with the test execution results.
