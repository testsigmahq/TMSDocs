**You can create, run, and manage your tests inside Jira. Just like you do in Test Management by Testsigma.**

---

The Testsigma Integration for Jira app seamlessly extends Jira’s core capabilities to include native test management. This allows teams to create, manage, and track test cases and test runs directly from the Jira environment, without switching to Test Management by Testsigma. You can add test results to stories, streamline workflows, and maintain testing continuity within Jira. The integration enhances issue tracking, accelerates testing cycles, and improves collaboration between QA and development teams from a unified workspace.
