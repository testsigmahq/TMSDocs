Managing test cases shouldn't be a mess. If you're using traditional Test Management tools or Excel for it, you know the pain! Endless spreadsheets, scattered data, and lots of copy-pasting. As the projects grow, things only get worse.

Test Management isn’t just about managing tests, it’s about making testing work for you, not against you!
