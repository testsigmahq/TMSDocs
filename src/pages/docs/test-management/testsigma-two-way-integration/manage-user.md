**With unified access control, you can invite users to Testsigma, Test Management, or both directly from one place.**

---

You can manage user access across both Testsigma and Test Management by Testsigma from a single interface. When inviting users, you can choose to add them to either one or both products by selecting the relevant checkbox in the invite dialog.

In Testsigma, you can add new users, assign project-level roles, and optionally add them to Test Management by Testsigma. Similarly, in Test Management by Testsigma, you can invite users and choose to add them to Testsigma.

This unified user management approach helps maintain consistent access, simplifies onboarding, and ensures seamless collaboration across both platforms.
